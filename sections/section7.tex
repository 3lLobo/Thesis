We will discuss certain aspects of our results and give advice on further research.

\subsection{Discuss Aspect 1}

Well well well

\subsection{Future Work}

There are many avenues to follow for future work.

Basing on the believe that the experiments were successful, we recommend:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improve the model (deeper)
    \item link the latent space to word signals e,g text
    \item prior not normal, e.g NF
    \item try a GAN
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Good luck amigos!}
