We will discuss certain aspects of our results and give advice on further research.

\subsection{Discuss RGVAE Link Predictor}

% Well well well

Poor results when using ELBO loss.

Variational Inference does not add value to embedding based link predictors.

Relaxation of the latent space allows the RGVAE to score competitively, yet the vast difference in complexity compared to simple embedding based models devalues its useability. 

\subsection{Discuss Generated Knowledge}

Higher dimension of freedom when generating graphs using Graph matching.

All valid generated triples are unseen in both train and test set. 

Problem seems to be the Gaussian prior.

\subsection{Future Work}

There are many avenues to follow for future work.

Basing on the believe that further research will be fruitful, we recommend:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Smarter approach for graph matching, let a NN learn the best permutation given the targe and prediction
    \item Separate MLP for each adjacency and edge attributes
    \item Improve the model (deeper)
    \item link the latent space to word signals e,g text
    \item prior not normal, e.g NF
    \item try a GAN
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Happy New Year!}
