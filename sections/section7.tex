We will discuss certain aspects of our results and give advice on further research.

\subsection{Discuss RGVAE Link Predictor}

% Well well well

\subsection{Discuss Generated Knowledge}


\subsection{Future Work}

There are many avenues to follow for future work.

Basing on the believe that further research will be fruitful, we recommend:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Smarter approach for graph matching, let a NN learn the best permutation given the targe and prediction
    \item Separate MLP for each adjacency and edge attributes
    \item Improve the model (deeper)
    \item link the latent space to word signals e,g text
    \item prior not normal, e.g NF
    \item try a GAN
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Happy New Year!}
