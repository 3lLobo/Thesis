Here comes a beautiful introduction. Promise!

\subsection{Motivation}

Computer vision reached a point, where semantics, entities and relations can be infered in an simple image.
Would it not be fantastic to be able to apply this to text too?
Could we train a model to learn the semantics of a KG?

\subsection{Expected Contribution}

This thesis is aimed to be at fundamental research and provide insight, into if further research in this direction would be meaningful.

\subsection{Research Question}

\texttt{How well can a VAE learn the underlying semantics of a KG?}
