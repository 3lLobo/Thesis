% Experiments

This section presents the experiments we ran. We covered link and node prediction and compared those to SOTA scores. Further we ran experiments on investigating the coherence of the reproduced graph structure. Lastly we measured the adherence of our model to the KG's underlying syntax.

\subsection{Link Prediction}
The task of link prediction, tests, if the model can recognize the relation between two entities. In order to do so, we hide the second entity of a triple and let our model to predict it.

\subsection{Node Prediciton}

\subsection{Sanity Checks}

\subsection{Syntax coherence}
