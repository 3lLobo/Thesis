Like the moon, who needs the sun to shine, I am but a reflection of the beautiful souls who supported me throughout this thesis.

I am forever grateful for the support from Deloitte, for the kindness, feedback and inspiration I received from my wonderful colleagues at Digital Risk Solutions. Especially I want to thank Patrick Hafkenscheid for his guidance and Marc Vandonk for believing in my talent.

I thank Peter Bloem and Thiviyan Thanapalasingam for putting me on the right track and for their unlimited patience during the supervision of this thesis. Further thank-yous to my classmates Kiara, Niels and Basti for our fruitful discussions and for helping me overcome my academic self-doubts. Gratitude to the UvA for being the Hogwarts of my childhood dreams.

Infinito agradecimiento a Papi y Mami, no solo por el apoyo durante estos ultimos meses, pero por las oportunidades, la educacion y el amor que me dieron toda mi vida. Los amo mucho!

No matter if highs or lows, crying or laughing, I love every single moment we share.
