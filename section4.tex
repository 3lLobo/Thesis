This section describes the methodology for this thesis. The first part includes the presentation of the model, the reprocessing of the input and the evaluation metrics. The second part describes the experimental setup and the different experimental runs. The work of this thesis has aimed to be fully reproducable, thus the code is opensourced and available on Github \footnote{***Thesis Repo***}.
